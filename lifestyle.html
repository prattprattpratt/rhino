    <p>Rhinos tend to live where they like to eat. The black rhino is a browser. Its triangular-shaped upper lip, which ends in a grasping point, is used to eat a large variety of vegetationâ€”including leaves; buds; and shoots of plants, bushes, and trees. It can be found in various habitats that have dense, woody vegetation.<br>- www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/rhinoceros</p>
